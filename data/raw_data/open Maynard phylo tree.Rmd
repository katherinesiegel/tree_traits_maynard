## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# open libary, plot tree in 2 forms

```{r}
library(ape)
maynardtree <- read.tree("C:/Users/krist/OneDrive/Desktop/R/tree_traits_maynard/data/raw_data/dichotomous_phylogenetic_tree.tree")
maynardtree <- ape::read.tree("C:/Users/krist/OneDrive/Desktop/R/tree_traits_maynard/data/raw_data/dichotomous_phylogenetic_tree.tree")
plot(maynardtree,type="fan",cex=0.1,lwd=0.5, no.margin=TRUE)
plot(maynardtree,no.margin=TRUE,edge.width = 0.5, cex=0.2)

```
