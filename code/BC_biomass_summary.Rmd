### sum of biomass for each nfi plot (ltp)

### open large tree plot tree file

### select only relevant data columns

### replace NA values as 0

### merge biomass summary and resurveyed files (ltp)
```{r}

### check similarities between file headers

### merge the files based on nfi plot and meas_date
BC_ltp_biomass_merged <- merge(BC_ltp_biomass_sum, BC_ltp_resurveyed) %>%
  mutate(percent / 100) %>% # divide percent by 100 to obtain decimal value
  mutate(percent/100 * biomass_total) # multiple decimal percent by total bioimass to obtain biomass per species

### rename additional column
colnames(BC_ltp_biomass_merged)[16] <- "biomass_composition"

### remove unnecessary columns
BC_ltp_biomass_merged$...1 <- NULL

### save as csv
